# Databricks App Deployment Guide - OBO Configuration

## 🎯 Overview

This Databricks App is configured to use **On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication**, ensuring that each user's queries are executed with their own permissions, enabling Row-Level Security (RLS).

---

## 📋 OBO Configuration Checklist

### ✅ 1. App Code Configuration (Already Done!)

**File: `app.py`**

The app is already configured to extract and use user credentials:

```python
# Line 681-686 in app.py
user_token = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Access-Token')
user_email = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Email', 'unknown')
print(f"Processing request for user: {user_email}")
print(f"Using OBO token: {'Yes' if user_token else 'No (fallback to app token)'}")

# Pass user token to agent
agent_response = get_agent_response(conversation_history, user_token=user_token)
```

✅ **Status: Implemented**

---

### ✅ 2. App Startup Configuration

**File: `app.yaml`**

```yaml
command:
  - python
  - app.py
```

This ensures the app runs the web UI (`app.py`), not the agent code (`agent.py`).

✅ **Status: Updated**

---

### ⚠️ 3. Databricks Apps UI Settings

**You MUST enable OBO in the Databricks Apps UI:**

1. **Go to:** Databricks workspace → Apps → Your app → Settings

2. **Find:** "User authorization" or "OAuth" section

3. **Verify these settings:**
   ```
   ✅ User authorization: Enabled (Preview)
   ✅ OAuth2 App Client ID: <auto-generated>
   ✅ API Scopes: At minimum, default scopes
   ```

4. **Required API Scopes for this app:**
   - `iam.current-user:read` (default)
   - `iam.access-control:read` (default)
   - **Additional scopes may be auto-requested when calling the agent**

---

### ⚠️ 4. Service Principal Configuration

**The app needs BOTH:**

1. **Service Principal** (for app infrastructure)
   - Environment vars: `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Used for: App initialization, non-user-specific operations
   
2. **User Authorization** (for OBO)
   - Header: `X-Forwarded-Access-Token`
   - Used for: Agent calls, user-specific queries

**Both are automatically provided by Databricks Apps when configured correctly.**

## 🔍 How OBO Works in Your App

### Architecture Flow:

```
1. User (alice@company.com) opens the app in browser
   ↓
2. Databricks Apps injects headers:
   - X-Forwarded-Email: alice@company.com
   - X-Forwarded-Access-Token: <Alice's OAuth token>
   ↓
3. app.py extracts user token from headers
   ↓
4. app.py calls Model Serving Endpoint with Alice's token
   ↓
5. Agent uses Alice's credentials (OBO)
   ↓
6. Genie queries tables as Alice
   ↓
7. Unity Catalog applies RLS based on Alice's permissions
   ↓
8. Returns ONLY data Alice can see (e.g., HR only)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update App Code
```bash
# Already done - code is in Git
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Databricks App

**In Databricks Apps UI:**

1. **App source:**
   - Source: Git repository
   - Path: Point to your repo
   - Branch: `main`

2. **App authorization:**
   - ✅ Service principal: Created automatically
   - ✅ User authorization: **ENABLE THIS** (Preview feature)

3. **Save and Deploy**

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

**Check deployment logs for:**
```
✅ Starting server on http://0.0.0.0:8080
✅ Dash is running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/
✅ Authentication mode: Databricks Apps (using on-behalf-of authentication)
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ Agent configuration loaded
❌ LangGraphResponsesAgent initialized
```

---

## 🧪 Testing OBO

### Test 1: Check Headers

**In app logs, you should see:**
```
Processing request for user: your.email@company.com
Using OBO token: Yes
```

**If you see:**
```
Using OBO token: No (fallback to app token)
```
→ ❌ **User authorization not enabled in app settings!**

---

### Test 2: Verify RLS Enforcement

**User A (HR access):**
```
Query: "Show me attrition by department"
Expected: Only HR department
```

**User B (Sales access):**
```
Query: "Show me attrition by department"
Expected: Only Sales department
```

**If all users see ALL departments:**
→ ❌ **OBO not working - check app authorization settings!**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Using OBO token: No"

**Cause:** User authorization not enabled in Databricks Apps

**Fix:**
1. Go to app settings
2. Find "User authorization" section
3. Enable it (may be marked as "Preview")
4. Redeploy app

---

### Issue 2: "Error reading app.yaml file"

**Cause:** Invalid app.yaml format

**Fix:** The current `app.yaml` uses minimal valid format:
```yaml
command:
  - python
  - app.py
```

If this still fails, remove `app.yaml` and configure startup command through UI.

---

### Issue 3: App runs agent.py instead of app.py

**Symptoms:**
```
Logs show: "Agent configuration loaded"
```

**Fix:**
1. Check `app.yaml` command is `python app.py`
2. Or set startup command in UI to `python app.py`
3. Restart app

---

### Issue 4: All users see all data (RLS not working)

**Causes:**
1. User authorization not enabled → Enable in app settings
2. Agent not configured for OBO → Already fixed in code
3. Genie Space credential mode set to "embedded" → Check Genie Space settings

**Fix for #3:**
- Go to Genie Space settings
- Find "Credential mode"
- Should be: "Run as viewer" (not "Embedded credentials")

---

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] App loads in browser (no "Agent configuration loaded" errors)
- [ ] App logs show user email when you interact with it
- [ ] App logs show "Using OBO token: Yes"
- [ ] Different users see different data based on RLS
- [ ] No permission denied errors in app responses

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

**What's protected by OBO:**
- ✅ Genie Space queries (user-specific)
- ✅ Unity Catalog table access (RLS enforced)
- ✅ Model serving endpoint calls (user context preserved)

**What uses Service Principal:**
- App initialization and startup
- Non-user-specific operations (if any)

**User privacy:**
- User tokens are NOT logged
- Only user emails are logged for debugging
- Tokens are passed through memory, not stored

---

## 📞 Quick Reference

**App.yaml location:** Root of repo  
**Startup command:** `python app.py`  
**Main file:** `app.py` (web UI)  
**Agent file:** `agent.py` (generated, for model serving endpoint)  
**OBO configuration:** Lines 681-686 in app.py  

**Key setting in Databricks Apps UI:**  
→ User authorization: **MUST BE ENABLED** ⚠️

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your app is working correctly when:

1. ✅ App loads and shows chat UI
2. ✅ Logs show: "Using OBO token: Yes"
3. ✅ User A sees only their permitted data
4. ✅ User B sees only their permitted data (different from User A)
5. ✅ No permission denied errors
6. ✅ RLS is enforced based on user identity

---

**If you're still seeing issues, check that "User authorization" is enabled in the Databricks Apps UI settings. This is the most common missing configuration!** ⚠️
